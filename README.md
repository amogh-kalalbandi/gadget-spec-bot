# gadget-spec-bot

This bot contains description of mobile phones released. Type in the mobile phone name and see the bot generate the description of the mobile phone.

The intention to create this bot is to capture specifications of all electronic gadgets be it mobile phones, smart watches, Laptops, Tabs, even Blenders. So that its a one stop place to research arrive at your buying decision. Unfortunately I was able to do it only for phones, but can be easily extended to Other Electronic Gadgets.
